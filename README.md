# IBM AI ENGINEERING SPECIALIZATION
This repository contains codes to the final projects I completed in fulfillment of the individual courses available in the IBM AI Engineering Specialization.

## Machine-Learning with Python
In fulfillment of IBM's Machine Learning certificate program

## Introduction to Computer Vision 

## Introduction to Keras
In this project, I was tasked to build a regression model using the Keras library to model data about concrete compressive strength

Concrete Data Description:
The data is available at https://cocl.us/concrete_data. To recap, the predictors in the data of concrete strength include:

Cement

Blast Furnace Slag

Fly Ash

Water

Superplasticizer

Coarse Aggregate

Fine Aggregate
